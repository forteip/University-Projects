Notable University Projects
Mark checker - Collaborative application designed to allow a user to login and allow them to check corresponding marks and classes from a database. 
               Sadly this is not the final product, but snapshot from the development process as the final product has been completely lost.
               
Mobile App   - Another Collaborative project, this time focused on user interface design. This project was centered mainly around developing an 
               application that was designed to target a specific problem and design the UI for such an application. Instead of code work, it focused
               heavily on research and testing. The working UI prototype can be found in A6 as a sketch file
SQL 
Assignments - A sample of assignments and projects that cover database and SQL
