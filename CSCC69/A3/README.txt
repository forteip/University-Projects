Linking hard links is difficult due to the isolation of each process. To check for hard links, we would have to compare hard links to see if they share inodes and if we want to identify which file is the original, we would have to compare creation dates. This is difficult as by design, using fork creates isolated processes that can only pass information to children as arguments, and receive return values only by waiting, it makes it less than simple to compare the required information to determine if a hard link should be copied or not.
